* **TO DO LIST is a list of tasks you need to complete or things you want to do. Most typically, they're organised in order of priority.**

* **By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important. And by prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave until later.**

-  Meet other local moms and expecting mothers like you
-  Connect with other moms just like you
-  Build your local community of moms
-  Share photos, videos and updates of your journey through motherhood
