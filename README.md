#### SOCIAL MOM

* It is found that 80% of all new moms feels lonely. 100% of them have questions on motherhood. They need to connect with other moms, to exchange tips, share struggles, and just go for a walk, or to the park for a little mental relief. 

* SOCIAL MOM is a place where moms would encourage one another. An uplifting network of moms where we can cry together and also celebrate together. Where we can ask all our questions freely. I mean ALL of them! And finally, somewhere to go when we need relevant information, expert’s resources, to guide us in our wonderful motherhood journey!

* We are all from different backgrounds but what unites us is our will to raise amazing children.
